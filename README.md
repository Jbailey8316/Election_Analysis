# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
  A Colorado Board of Elections has asked me to complete an audit that includes the following tasks for a recent local congressional election:
  * Determine the total number of votes.
  * Compile a list of all candidates
  * Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
  * Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
  * Determine the winner of the elction based on popular vote.
  
## Resources
  * Data Source: election_results.csv
  * Software: Pyhton 3.9.2 64 bit, Visual Studio Code 1.54.1

## Summary
  *The anaylsis of the election show that:*
  * Total number of votes cast was: 369,711
  * Candidiates were:
    * Charles Casper Stockham
    * Diana DeGette
    * Raymon Anthony Doane
  * The candidate results were:
    * Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote with 85,213 votes.
    * Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes.
    * Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes.
  * The winner of the election was:
      * Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes

## Challenge Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections has asked for more data related to the election:
  * Voter turnout for each county.
  * Percentage of votes from each county out of the total votes.
  * The county with the highest turn out.
  
## Challenge Summary
  *The anaylsis of the counties during the election show:*
  * Voter turnout per county was:
    * Jefferson: 38,855 votes
    * Denver: 306,055 votes
    * Arapahoe: 24,801 votes
  * County percenatges are:
    * Jefferson: 10.5% of total votes
    * Denver: 82.8% of total votes
    * Arapahoe: 6.7% of total votes
  * The county with the highest voter turnout was Denver.

## Election-Audit Summary
This proposal is for the Colorado Board of Elections to provide an expansion on the usefulness of this script.  So far I have demostrated its ability to compile data from a local congressional election and return key data points such as total number of votes and voting outcomes.  With some modifications this script could potentially be used for any election held.  Currently the information provided only covered a small selection of candidates and county data.  If more data can be aquired; this code could be modifed to anaylze things such as voter turnout based on affiliated parties, total votes state wide across multiple counties or even the potential to compile multiple states.
